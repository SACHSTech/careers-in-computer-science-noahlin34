* Debugging code
* Collaborating with (in some cases) a large team to ensure the development process is moving efficiently and to fix any issues/divide responsibilities

Unfortunately, the computer programming industry as a whole is extremely competitive, with a minimum of a bachelor's degree in a relevant field being virtually a blanket requirement for the even most entry level positions. This position is no different, with most employers requiring a minimum of a BSc in computer science or a relevant field. Preference can also be given to people who have recieved additional training, like certificates showing they've completed online courese to prove their profficiency in certain development tools or languages. 

## Required Technical and Non-Technical Skills

## University Paths for Related Programs

The University of Toronto offers a very competitive and highly desired computer science program, allowing graduates to recieve a BSc. 

### Entrance Requirements
The program is highly competitive requiring a minimum of an average in the low 90s, but acceptance may require a significantly higher average. The only prerequisite courses are ENG4U and MCV4U. 

### First Year Courses
Typically, if a student wanted to persue a career in computer science, they would have to take CSCA08 - Introduction to Computer Science I, and CSCA67 - Discrete Mathematics. CSCA08 is designed to introduce students to the discipline, and it is built assuming students have no prior exposure to computer science. CSC67 is meant to provide relevant math skills students will need for their more senior years of computer science. 

### Length of Time
Typically, it will take 4 years to complete the undergraduate program and earn a Bachelor of Science. 

## Valuable Learning Opporitunities
With how competitive the field is becoming, it is not uncommon for employers to want a candidate who has educated themsleves in the field outside of formal schooling. 

One thing that is particularly valued by many employers is online certificates. There are various online courses that, when completed, will provide certification to prove that the candidate is profficient in using the given tool or skill. Many large companies like [Google](https://grow.google/certificates/#?modal_active=none) and [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/) have online courses to complete. These certificates are recognized by the industry and can improve employability. 

Outside of this, personal projects can also make a person appear as a stronger candidate. Having a large portfolio of online coding projects in a personal website or GitHub repository can help prove the person's drive and passion for computer science, as well as being a display of skill.
